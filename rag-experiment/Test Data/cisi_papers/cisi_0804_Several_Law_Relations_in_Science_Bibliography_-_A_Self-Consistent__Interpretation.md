Interpretation
author: Naranan, S.
---

Several power law relations are found to occur in bibliographic studies of
scientific journals, articles, and citations.. These can be interpreted in a
self-consistent manner in terms of growth parameters of articles, journals, and 
citations.. Similar models have been proposed earlier in physical, biological, 
and behavioral sciences..
